# YouTube Video Script: How I Made an AI Agent that Applies for Jobs on LinkedIn

## Introduction
*Hi everyone! Welcome to today's video! I'm super excited to share with you a project I've been working on - an AI agent that can autonomously apply for jobs on LinkedIn!*

*In this video, we'll dive into every aspect of the project so you can understand how it all works and even build one yourself if you want to!*

## High-Level Overview
*So, what exactly does this agent do? At a high level:*
- *The agent uses web automation to navigate LinkedIn.*
- *It searches for job postings based on predefined criteria.*
- *It selects job listings that have an 'Easy Apply' option.*
- *It fills out and submits the application automatically.*

*Sounds pretty cool, right? Let's break down how all of this is achieved.*

## What is a Code Agent?
*You might be wondering, what's a code agent, and how is it different from a regular agent? Well:*
- *A regular agent typically refers to an entity that can perform tasks autonomously.*
- *A code agent, however, specifically writes its actions as code and can dynamically generate new code to perform its tasks.*

*In this project, we used a code agent, which allowed us to leverage the power of dynamic coding to handle various tasks on LinkedIn. This approach provides flexibility and adaptability in interaction.*

## Explanation of the smolagents Library
*We utilized the amazing smolagents library from Hugging Face, which provides a simple framework for building powerful agents. Some key points about smolagents:*
- *‚ú® Simplicity: The library has minimal abstractions and is easy to use.*
- *üåê Support for any LLM: It supports models from the Hugging Face Hub, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.*
- *üßë‚Äçüíª First-class support for Code Agents: Great for agents that write their own code!*

*This library played a huge role in making our AI agent both effective and efficient.*

## Tools for Web and Human Interaction
*To interact with the web and humans, we used a set of tools integrated into the agent:*
- *Web Automation: Selenium, with the Helium library for simplified web interactions.*
- *Human Intervention Tool: This tool allows for user input and decision-making during the agent's runtime, adding an extra layer of versatility.*

## Interesting or Complex Parts of the Code
*Now let's delve into some of the interesting and complex parts of our code:*

### Environment Setup and Configuration
*We start by loading environment variables and configuring Selenium to work with an undetected Chrome Driver.*

### Custom Tool Definitions
*We defined custom tools for our agent to interact with the web:*

### Human Intervention
*To handle situations where human decision-making is necessary, we created a `HumanInterventionTool`:*


## Demo of the Agent in Action
*Let's see our agent in action! Here's a demo where the agent logs into LinkedIn, searches for 'AI engineer jobs' in Switzerland, and attempts to apply for an 'Easy Apply' job.*

*Watch as it navigates the site, identifies relevant job listings, and goes through the application process autonomously. It's like having your personal job application assistant!*

## Conclusion and Future Improvements
*In conclusion, we've built an AI agent that can autonomously apply for jobs on LinkedIn - a task that can save a lot of time and effort!*

*Future improvements could include:*
- *Improving the human intervention mechanism to handle non-standard job application pages.*
- *Expanding the agent's capabilities to handle more complex application processes.*
- *Integrating more advanced decision-making algorithms.*
